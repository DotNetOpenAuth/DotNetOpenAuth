			<p><b>Important note:</b> Do <b>not</b> check the &quot;Allow [this site] to remember me&quot; 
				check box while Google is asking for verification. Doing so will make this 
				sample only work once for your account. If you do check it, you can restore this

			<p>Due to the way Google matches realms and consumer keys, this demo will only work
				when it is run under http://demo.dotnetopenauth.net/. By registering your own consumer
				key with Google and changing the configuration of this sample, you can run it on
				your own public web site, but it can never work from a private (localhost or firewall-protected)
				address. </p>
