<h2>NUnit-Console Command Line Options</h2>
<p>The console interface has a few additional options compared to the forms 
	interface. The command line must always specify one or more file names. The 
	console interface always creates an XML representation of the test results. 
	This file by default is called TestResult.xml and is placed in the working 
	directory.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> By default the nunit-console program is not added to your path. You 
	must do this manually if this is the desired behavior.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Under the Windows operating system, options may be prefixed by either
    a forward slash or a hyphen. Under Linux, a hyphen must be used. Options that
	take values may use an equal sign, a colon or a space to separate the option 
	from its value.</p>
<h4>Specifying an Assembly</h4>
The console program must always have an assembly or project specified. To run 
the tests contained in the nunit.tests.dll use the following command:
<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console nunit.tests.dll</pre>
</p>
<p>To run the tests in nunit.tests.dll through the Visual Studio project, use:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console nunit.tests.csproj</pre>
</p>
<p>To run the same tests through an NUnit test project you have defined, use:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console nunit.tests.nunit</pre>
</p>
<h4>Specifying an Assembly and a Test to be Run</h4>
<p>You may specify a test to be run by proviig the full name of the test along
with the containing assembly. For example to run NUnit.Tests.AssertionTests
in the nunit.tests assembly use the following command:
<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console /run:NUnit.Tests.AssertionTests nunit.tests.dll</pre>

<p>The name of the test to be run may be that of a test case, test fixture or
a namespace. Unlike the <b>/fixture</b> option, this option affects the running
rather than the loading of the tests. Consequently it supports much broader use,
including situations involving SetUpFixtures, which are not run if the class
in question is not loaded. You should use <b>/run</b> in lieu of <b>/fixture</b>
in most cases.

<h4>Specifying an Assembly and a Fixture to be Loaded</h4>
<p>When specifying a fixture, you must give the full name of the test fixture 
	along with the containing assembly. For example, to load the 
	NUnit.Tests.AssertionTests in the nunit.tests.dll assembly use the following 
	command:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console /fixture:NUnit.Tests.AssertionTests nunit.tests.dll</pre>
</p>
<p>The name specified after the <b>/fixture</b> option may be that of a TestFixture 
	class, a legacy suite (using the Suite property ) or a namespace. If a 
	namespace is given, then all fixtures under that namespace are loaded.</p>
<p>This option is provided for backward compatibility. In most cases, you will
be better served by using the <b>/run</b> option.
	
<h4>Specifying the Version of the CLR</h4>

<p>Most applications are written to run under a specific version of the CLR.
A few are designed to operate correctly under multiple versions. In either case,
it is important to be able to specify the CLR version to be used for testing.</p>

<p>When only one version of the CLR is used, the config files for nunit-gui and
nunit-console may be set up to specify that version. As a more convenient
alternative when switching CLRs, you may use the provided <b>clr.bat</b>
command to specify the version under which NUnit should run.</p>

<p>For example, to run the tests in nunit.tests.dll under the RTM version of 
the .Net 2.0 framework, use:</p>

<pre class="programtext">       clr net-2.0 nunit-console nunit.tests.dll</pre>

<p>The <b>clr.bat</b> file is located in the NUnit <b>bin</b> directory. You may
put this on your path, or copy it to a convenient location. Enter <b>clr /?</b> 
for a list of options.</p>
	
<p><b>Note:</b> If you use a &lt;startup&gt; section in the config file, it takes
precedence over this option.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This command is specific to the Microsoft .Net 
framework. The Mono framework provides other means to specify the version
to be used when running a command.</p>

<h4>Specifying Test Categories to Include or Exclude</h4>
<p>NUnit provides CategoryAttribute for use in marking tests as belonging to 
	one or more categories. Categories may be included or excluded in a test run 
	using the <b>/include</b> and <b>/exclude</b> options. The following command 
	runs only the tests in the BaseLine category:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console myassembly.dll /include:BaseLine</pre>
</p>
<p>The following command runs all tests <b>except</b> those in the Database 
	category:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console myassembly.dll /exclude:Database</pre>
</p>
<p>
Multiple categories may be specified on either option, by using commas to 
separate them.
<p><b>Notes:</b> Beginning with NUnit 2.4, the /include and /exclude options may
   be combined on the command line. When both are used, all tests with the included 
   categories are run except for those with the excluded categories.</p>
   
<p>Beginning with NUnit 2.4.6, you may use a <b>Category Expression</b> with either
of these options:
<dl>
	<dt>A|B|C
	<dd>Selects tests having any of the categories A, B or C.
	<dt>A,B,C
	<dd>Selects tests having any of the categories A, B or C.
	<dt>A+B+C
	<dd>Selects only tests having all three of the categories assigned
	<dt>A+B|C
	<dd>Selects tests with both A and B OR with category C.
	<dt>A+B-C
	<dd>Selects tests with both A and B but not C.
	<dt>-A
	<dd>Selects tests not having category A assigned
	<dt>A+(B|C)
	<dd>Selects tests having both category A and either of B or C
</dl>
<p>The comma operator is equivalent to | but has a higher precendence. Order
of evaluation is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Unary exclusion operator (-)
<li>High-precendence union operator (,)
<li>Intersection and set subtraction operators (+ and binary -)
<li>Low-precedence union operator (|)
</ol>

   
<p>For a clear understanding of how category 
	selection works, review the documentation for both the 
	<a href="category.html">Category Attribute</a> and the 
	<a href="explicit.html">Explicit Attribute</a>.</p>
<h4>Redirecting Output</h4>
<p>The output that is normally shown on the console may be redirected to a file. 
	This includes output created by the test program as well as what NUnit itself 
	creates. The following command redirects standard output to the TestResult.txt 
	file:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console nunit.tests.dll /out:TestResult.txt</pre>
</p>
<p>The following command redirects standard error output to the StdErr.txt file.
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console nunit.tests.dll /err:StdErr.txt</pre>
</p>
<h4>Labeling Test Output</h4>
<p>The output from each test normally follows right after that of the preceding 
	test. You may use the <b>/labels</b> option to cause an identifying label to be 
	displayed at the start of each test case.</p>
<h4>Specifying the XML file name</h4>
<p>As stated above, the console program always creates an XML representation of the 
	test results. To change the name of the output file to 
	&quot;console-test.xml&quot; use the following command line option:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console /xml:console-test.xml nunit.tests.dll</pre>
</p>
<h4>Specifying the Transform file</h4>
<p>The console interface uses XSLT to transform the test results from the XML file 
	to what is printed to the screen when the program executes. The console 
	interface has a default transformation that is part of the executable. To 
	specify your own transformation named &quot;myTransform.xslt&quot; use the 
	following command line option:
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console /transform:myTransform.xslt nunit.tests.dll</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> For additional information see the XML schema for the test results. 
	This file is in the same directory as the executable and is called
	<a href="files/Results.xsd">Results.xsd</a>. 
	The default transform <a href="files/Summary.xslt">Summary.xslt</a>	is located in the core source directory.</p>
<h4>Specifying which Configuration to run</h4>
<p>When running tests from a Visual Studio or NUnit project, the first 
	configuration found will be loaded by default. Usually this is Debug. The 
	configuration loaded may be controlled by using the <b>/config</b> switch. The 
	following will load and run tests for the Release configuration of 
	nunit.tests.dll.
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console nunit.tests.csproj /config:Release</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This option has no effect when loading an assembly directly.</p>
<h4>Specifying Multiple Assemblies</h4>
<p>You may run tests from multiple assemblies in one run using the console 
	interface even if you have not defined an NUnit test project file. The 
	following command would run a suite of tests contained in assembly1.dll, 
	assembly2.dll and assembly3.dll.
	<pre class="programtext">        nunit-console assembly1.dll assembly2.dll assembly3.dll</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b> You may specify multiple assemblies, but not multiple NUnit or 
	Visual Studio projects on the command line. Further, you may not specify an 
	NUnit or Visual Studio project together with a list of assemblies.</p>
<p>Beginning with NUnit 2.4, the console loads multiple assemblies specified
   in this way into separate AppDomains by default. You may provide a separate
   config file for each assembly. You may override the default by use of the
   <b>/domain</b> option.
<p>Beginning with NUnit 2.4, the <b>/fixture</b>
	option, when used with multiple assemblies, will run tests matching the 
	fixture name in all the assemblies. In earlier versions, only the first
	test found was executed.</p>
<h4>Controlling the Use of AppDomains</h4>
<p>The <b>/domain</b> option controls of the creation of AppDomains for running tests.
    The following values are recognized:</p>
	<dl style="margin-left: 2em">
	<dt><b>None</b>
	<dd>No domain is created - the tests are run in the primary domain. This normally
	requires copying the <b>NUnit</b> assemblies into the same directory as your tests.
	<dt><b>Single</b>
	<dd>A test domain is created - this is how NUnit worked prior to version 2.4
	<dt><b>Multiple</b>
	<dd>A separate test domain is created for each assembly
	</dl>
<p>The default is to use multiple domains if multiple assemblies are listed on 
	the command line. Otherwise a single domain is used.</p>
<h4>Other Options</h4>
<p>The <b>/noshadow</b> option disables shadow copying of the assembly in order to 
	provide improved performance.</p>
<p>The <b>/thread</b> option causes a separate thread to be created for running the 
	tests. This is necessary in cases where the tests must run in a particular type 
	of apartment. By running in a separate thread, the ApartmentState and 
	ThreadPriority settings under the
	<TestRunner>
	element of the config file will be honored. If no thread is created, these are 
	ignored and the apartment will be the same as that of the console program.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>The apartment state of the console program may change from release 
	to release, so users requiring a particular apartment should take advantage of 
	this setting rather than relying on the default.</p>
<p>The <b>/wait</b> option causes the program to wait for user input before 
	exiting. This is useful when running nunit-console from a shortcut.</p>
<p>The <b>/xmlconsole</b> option displays raw XML output on the console rather than 
	transforming it. This is useful when debugging problems with the XML format.</p>
<p>The <b>/nologo</b> option disables display of the copyright information at the 
	start of the program.</p>
<p>The <b>/help</b> or <b>/?</b> option displays a brief help message</p>
