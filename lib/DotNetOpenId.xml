            OpenID associations may be shared between Provider and Relying Party (smart
            associations), or be a way for a Provider to recall its own secret for later
            (dumb associations).

            <remarks>
            The longer the bit length, the more secure the identities of your visitors are.
            Setting a value higher than 256 on a relying party site may reduce performance
            as many association requests will be denied, causing secondary requests or even
            authentication failures.
            Setting a value higher than 256 on a provider increases security where possible

This policy also implies the Multi-Factor Authentication policy (http://schemas.openid.net/pape/policies/2007/06/multi-factor) and both policies MAY BE specified in conjunction without conflict. An example would be authentication using a password and a hardware token.

            This method first checks if this logger is <c>FATAL</c>
            enabled by comparing the level of this logger with the 
            <see cref="F:log4net.Core.Level.Fatal"/> level. If this logger is
            <c>FATAL</c> enabled, then it converts the message object
            (passed as parameter) to a string by invoking the appropriate
            <see cref="T:log4net.ObjectRenderer.IObjectRenderer"/>. It then 
            proceeds to call all the registered appenders in this logger 
            and also higher in the hierarchy depending on the value of the 
            additivity flag.

            <para>
            This function is intended to lessen the computational cost of
            disabled log debug statements.
            </para>
            <para> For some ILog interface <c>log</c>, when you write:</para>
            <code lang="C#">
            log.Debug("This is entry number: " + i );
            </code>
            <para>
            You incur the cost constructing the message, string construction and concatenation in
            this case, regardless of whether the message is logged or not.
            </para>
            <para>
            If you are worried about speed (who isn't), then you should write:
            </para>
            <code lang="C#">
            if (log.IsDebugEnabled)
            { 
                log.Debug("This is entry number: " + i );
            }
            </code>
            <para>
            This way you will not incur the cost of parameter
            construction if debugging is disabled for <c>log</c>. On
            the other hand, if the <c>log</c> is debug enabled, you
            will incur the cost of evaluating whether the logger is debug
            enabled twice. Once in <see cref="P:DotNetOpenId.Loggers.ILog.IsDebugEnabled"/> and once in
            the <see cref="M:DotNetOpenId.Loggers.ILog.Debug(System.Object)"/>.  This is an insignificant overhead
            since evaluating a logger takes about 1% of the time it
            takes to actually log. This is the preferred style of logging.
            </para>
            <para>Alternatively if your logger is available statically then the is debug
            enabled state can be stored in a static variable like this:
            </para>
            <code lang="C#">
            private static readonly bool isDebugEnabled = log.IsDebugEnabled;
            </code>
            <para>
            Then when you come to log you can write:
            </para>
            <code lang="C#">
            if (isDebugEnabled)
            { 
                log.Debug("This is entry number: " + i );
            }
            </code>
            <para>
            This way the debug enabled state is only queried once
            when the class is loaded. Using a <c>private static readonly</c>
            variable is the most efficient because it is a run time constant
            and can be heavily optimized by the JIT compiler.
            </para>
            <para>
            Of course if you use a static readonly variable to
            hold the enabled state of the logger then you cannot
            change the enabled state at runtime to vary the logging
            that is produced. You have to decide if you need absolute
            speed or runtime flexibility.

            An instance of this interface represents an identity assertion 
            from an OpenID Provider.  It may be in response to an authentication 
            request previously put to it by a Relying Party site or it may be an
            unsolicited assertion.

            Relying party web sites should handle both solicited and unsolicited 
            assertions.  This interface does not offer a way to discern between
            solicited and unsolicited assertions as they should be treated equally.

            The application-level store where associations with other OpenId providers can be
            preserved for optimized authentication and information about nonces can be stored.
            In a multi-server web farm environment, this store MUST be shared across
            all servers.  Optional: if null, the relying party will operate in stateless mode.
            </param>

            Optional.  The current incoming HTTP request that may contain an OpenId assertion.

            <param name="query">
            The name/value pairs that came in on the

            <remarks>
            The IRelyingPartyApplicationStore must be shared across an entire web farm 
            because of the design of how nonces are stored/retrieved.  Even if
            a given visitor is guaranteed to have affinity toward one server,
            replay attacks from another host may be directed at another server,
            which must therefore share the nonce information in the application
            state store in order to stop the intruder.

            As part of deserialization, the signature is verified to check

            <remarks>
            When communicating with an OP using OpenID 2.0, the provider takes
            care of the nonce, so we don't have to.
            
            If operating under stateless mode, nonces can't be used on the RP
            side, so we rely on the Provider to be using some nonce mechanism.
            In OpenID 2.0, this is guaranteed, but in 1.x it's just an 
            assumption, which allows for replay attacks if the assumption is false.

            If an application store exists, we should sign the token.  If it doesn't,

            Manual re-discovery of a Claimed Identifier is the slow way to perform verification.
            The best way is to check a signature on a deserialized token.  That is the primary method,
            but when stateless mode is used and no place exists to store a secret for signature
            verification, this is the only alternative.

            <para>This should be set to some constant value for an individual user.  
            For example, if <see cref="P:DotNetOpenId.Provider.IdentityEndpointNormalizationEventArgs.UserSuppliedIdentifier"/> indicates that identity page

            <list>
            <item>Normalize the capitalization of the URL: for example, change http://provider/BOB to
            http://provider/bob.</item>
            <item>Switch to HTTPS is it is offered: change http://provider/bob to https://provider/bob.</item>
            <item>Strip off the query string if it is not part of the canonical identity:
            https://provider/bob?timeofday=now becomes https://provider/bob</item>
            <item>Ensure that any trailing slash is either present or absent consistently.  For example,
            change https://provider/bob/ to https://provider/bob.</item>
            </list>
            <para>When this property is set, the <see cref="T:DotNetOpenId.Provider.IdentityEndpoint"/> control compares it to
            the request that actually came in, and redirects the browser to use the normalized identifier
            if necessary.</para>
            <para>Using the normalized identifier in the request is <i>very</i> important as it
            helps the user maintain a consistent identity across sites and across site visits to an individual site.
            For example, without normalizing the URL, Bob might sign into a relying party site as 
            http://provider/bob one day and https://provider/bob the next day, and the relying party
            site <i>should</i> interpret Bob as two different people because the URLs are different.
            By normalizing the URL at the Provider's identity page for Bob, whichever URL Bob types in
            from day-to-day gets redirected to a normalized form, so Bob is seen as the same person
            all the time, which is of course what Bob wants.

            This is the prefered key generation method, because it is very fast and very safe.
